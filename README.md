# CS-255

The DriverPass project was for the design of a complete system for DriverPass, a company aimed at helping students pass their driving tests. DriverPass recognized that more than 65% of students who went to driving exams failed because of poor preparation, usually based on prior test studies. The client's brief was to devise a system that will enable students to practice online simulation exams and behind-the-wheel training, in a bid to prepare themselves better for the actual driving test. This system will support various stakeholders, including IT, management, and customers, ensuring its smooth and user-friendly experience for all concerned.

I was good at translating the client's requirements into a clear and structured business requirements document. This document rightly captured the needs of DriverPass and gave a solid base for system design. The needs of the client were listened to with due care, and the incorporation of those needs in the functionalities of the system helped ensure that the final design will be aligned to expectation. I will be able to effectively communicate technical aspects of the system to stakeholders, notwithstanding their technical background.

If I were to improve one area of my work on these documents, I would choose to expound the process modeling section of the business requirements document. While the document did capture the essential needs quite well, a higher level of detail in the process flow—more so in handling edge cases and exceptions—would go a long way in making the system design more robust. Incorporating more decision points and alternate pathways in the UML diagrams would give a better view of the potential interactions that the system can have, hence ensuring all the user scenarios are well catered for.

Understanding and interpreting the needs of the user lay central to the success of this project. I went carefully through the interview transcript and copied out key requirements from various stakeholders regarding needs for online practice exams, scheduling on-the-road training, and securely managing data, all of which needed to be systematically put into the system design. This is important considering the user's needs because doing so will ensure that the system meets not only the technical specifications but also provides a good user experience principal to the system's adoption and effectiveness.

My approach toward software design is through user-centered design and iterative development. This is achieved by gaining a sufficient understanding of the user's needs and transforming them into clear, coherent, and actionable requirements. I use both process modeling and object modeling to ensure that the system in all its aspects is well-defined and integrated. In the future, I want to refine my approach by taking more user feedback during the design so that adjustments can be made and improvements added prior to final implementation. I also want to spend more time upfront on edge cases and exception handling to develop more robust systems.
